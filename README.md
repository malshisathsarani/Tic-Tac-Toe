Key Components
Game Board Representation:

The board is a 2D character array initialized with empty spaces to represent the 3x3 grid.
The positions on the board are indexed from 1 to 9 for user convenience.
Main Loop:

The game loop alternates between the player's turn and the computer's turn until the game is finished.
After each move, the board is printed, and the game checks if there is a winner or if the game is a tie.
Player's Turn:

The player is prompted to enter a position (1-9) to place their 'X' on the board.
The input is validated to ensure it corresponds to an empty cell on the board.
The move is then placed on the board.
Computer's Turn:

The computer randomly selects a position (1-9) to place its 'O' on the board.
The move is validated to ensure it corresponds to an empty cell on the board.
The move is then placed on the board.
Game State Checking:

The game checks for a win condition after each turn. A player wins if they have three of their symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
The game also checks for a tie, which occurs when all cells are filled without any player winning.
